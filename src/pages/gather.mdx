When I moved back from Berlin to the US, I had to pivot and find a job here. And if you couldn't tell from my last position at [Wonder](/wonder/), I kind of have a thing for spatial gathering apps. Specifically, trying to make remote work just as fun and engaging as being in an office.

So it only makes sense that I ended up at [Gather](https://www.gather.town/), where that's exactly what we're trying to do. Our motto these days is "never miss the office again". Wouldn't that be sweet?

Anyways, it's a ton of fun and a super great technical challenge. (oh, and, [we're hiring](https://www.gather.town/careers) ðŸ™‚)
