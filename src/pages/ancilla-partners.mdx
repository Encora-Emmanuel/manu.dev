In my last summer between semesters at UW-Madison, I was offered a position as Web Developer Intern at small company called Ancilla Partners. They manage apps and websites for healthcare organizations and their data.

This job was pretty crucial for me. While I had no problem focusing and performing well in classes at school, I had exactly 0 experience in software outside of the theoretical world of academia.

Because of this, I was learning sooooo much every single day at Ancilla. I learned what git was. Learned CSS and JavaScript and PHP and SQL. Learned what a "standup" was. And most importantly, started to learn how to learn on the job.

Admittedly, this job was pretty different than my others in hindsight. These days, I'd say I'm working with in a much more "modern" tech stack and exposed to more parts of the web dev stack as a whole. Regardless, I couldn't have gotten to where I am today if I wasn't given the opportunity to dip my toes in the water in 2016 ðŸ™‚
